 Gift message:  

 A gift you'll soon come to know

though I can't give it now, you must wait,
until the month with a festive fate,
As two cities meet with a joy so bright,
i'll give you this gift, a beam of light.
I wish you the happiest of birthdays Kobe and may your joy take flight.

Love -K


A gift awaits, though hidden from sight,
You'll discover it soon, in a time that's just right.
In the month of festivity, with joy so bright,
Two cities meet in a shimmering light.

Patience, dear Kobe, for the moment will show,
A present so special, its glow will bestow.
As your birthday dawns, may your joy take flight,
With love and warm wishes, your future's so bright.
